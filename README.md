Hello.
I like coding things. I like to make malware, operating systems and games.

I have made an [iso database](https://github.com/kiggy13/iso-database) containing different iso files for VMware and other stuff.
If you don't know what an ISO File is then read below this text
An ISO file is an exact copy of an entire optical disk such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray archived into a single file. This file, which is also sometimes referred to as an ISO image, is a smaller sized duplicate of large sets of data.
I also did not write that, I found it on [this website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-iso-file-explained-in-plain-english/)
